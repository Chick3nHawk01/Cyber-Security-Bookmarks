# Cybersecurity Browser Bookmarks

This repository contains curated cybersecurity browser bookmarks which you can import to your browser. I have compiled the bookmarks over the years while working as a SOC analyst. Some of these tools and resources I use every day, some more rarely. I hope they will be of good use to you. Feel free to contribute via issues or pull requests.

These bookmarks contain
* links to free online tools for everyday use in a SOC (e.g. for online malware analysis, threat intelligence research)
* links to free technical resources and documentation (e.g. IoC lists, generic SIEM use cases, threat hunting ideas, data collections, adversary techniques)
* links to similar tool & resource lists others have assembled on their GitHub
* links to relevant standards and frameworks (e.g. NISTIR, MITRE ATT&CK)
* links to further resources (e.g. HTTP status code documentation) and best pratices (e.g. CVE advisories)

Thank you to all the developers, administrators, authors and maintainers behind all the linked tools and resources!
